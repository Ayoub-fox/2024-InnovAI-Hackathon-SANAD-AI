# Pregnancy Support System (SANAD_AI)
## Abstract
Sanad is an AI-powered chatbot system designed to support pregnant women in Morocco by providing accessible pregnancy-related guidance in Moroccan Arabic (Darija). The system combines advanced language models with specialized medical knowledge to offer nutritional advice, answer general pregnancy questions, and provide postpartum support.
Background and Problem Statement
In Morocco, many pregnant women face challenges accessing reliable pregnancy-related information in their native language, Darija. While healthcare resources exist, language barriers and limited access to specialized medical advice create gaps in prenatal and postpartum care. This issue is particularly acute in:

Nutritional guidance during pregnancy
Daily pregnancy-related concerns
Postpartum care information

## Impact and Proposed Solution
Our solution addresses these challenges through:

Language Accessibility: Fully functional in Moroccan Darija
Specialized Agents:

Dietary Guidance Agent for nutritional advice
Question-Answering Agent for general pregnancy queries
